Please put the "donate_wall" folder into your /application/modules/ folder in FusionCMS.

The configuration can be done by editing the module config via the admin panel, or by manually editing the /donate_wall/config/donate.php config.

Go to paymentwall.com and create an application. Fill out the details as asked for. Pick for instance, the "Paymentwall Multi" widget. The default "widget code" for this is "p1_1" (you will need to enter this in the config for this module).

On your PaymentWall application, find the pingback section, and enter the following as pingback URL:
